# Python Learning

This repository contains Python programs I have written while learning the language.

## Contents

- Binary search tree
  - bst.py: Implements a binary search tree data structure and operations like insertion, search, deletion, etc.

## About

I am starting to learn Python programming and am using this repository to upload small projects as I learn new concepts. The programs are written to practice Python syntax, built-in data structures, algorithms, etc.

Feel free to browse through the code to get an idea of my learning journey! I will be adding more mini-projects as I continue to learn.

## Getting Started

The programs are written in Python 3 and above. To run them, simply clone the repository and execute the .py files. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/rkuma18/py_learn.git
cd py_learn
python bst.py
```
